## Project Overview
This is an analytical undertaking that provides an in-depth, holistic and concise insights on the global video-game ecosystem from a comprehensive dataset exploring sales, industry’s growth trends, regional performance of game titles overtime from North America, Japan, the EU, Africa, and the rest of the world for thirty-six thousand, seven hundred and fourteen (36,714) unique video game titles released from 1971-2024, including information like developers, publishers, critic's score, genres, consoles, and more. Using Microsoft Excel as a tool for analysis and visualization, insights and recommendations from this analysis would provide stakeholders and industry experts with relevant knowledge and requisite information on the dynamics of the video game industry with the aim to enhance data-driven and strategic decision-making for both economic and social benefits of the global video game ecosystem.

## Project Objectives
This project is committed to answering four (4) core questions about the global video game industry. Highlighted below are the guiding objectives for the analysis:
- **Video game titles that sold the most worldwide**: Video game titles with the most global presence in terms of revenue generated, unearthing key likely factors responsible for specific video game titles’ ascendancy on the global video game sales chart. 
- **Year with the highest sales and industry growth over time**: It becomes germane to examine periods in which the most and the least game titles were sold and more importantly, noticeable growth patterns and trough trends- identifying both arithmetic and exponential peaks and declines with commensuration between the number of video game titles sold and the revenue generated from the sales of video game titles in the over five decades of the global video game industry’s existence.
- **Consoles’ dominance in a particular genre**: To unravel whether specific video games consoles specialized in a particular genre, likely reasons for such console-genre specialization and subsequent influence on games development and consumer preference. 
- **Regional sales juxtaposition of video game titles**: To identify regional sales performance of specific video game titles across the globe drawing a line for sales performance comparison of top selling video game titles and uncover titles that are popular in certain regional markets but underperformed in others, highlighting income contribution of each region to the overall global income generated by the video game industry.

## Document Purpose
This documentation serves as a guide for stakeholders in the video game ecosystem, providing detailed-insights into the project's objectives, data source, data analysis, visualizations, and other relevant information.

## Skills Demonstrated
In the course of this project, the following Microsoft Excel features were incorporated: 
- Data processing and modification, 
- Filters, 
- Data analysis, 
- Data visualization

## Data Source
The data source for the project is a CSV (comma-separated value) file dataset downloaded from ![Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/datasets) website, containing pertinent and updated information about global video game sales. 
The dataset has fifty-nine thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six (59,966) rows and fourteen (14) columns. Excluding the URL column containing information not directly relevant to the analysis at hand, the columns are: Title, Console, Genre, Publisher, Developer, Critic Score, Total Sales (in millions), Sales Breakdown by Region (North America, Japan, PAL, Other), Release Date, and Last Update. 

## Data Processing and Modification
Checking through the video game sales dataset, no duplicate values were found. However, there are null values in columns such as Total-sales, Critic-score, North-American Sales, Japanese Sales, European-African Sales, Other-regions sales and Last-Update. While maintaining the principle of data quality, consistency and accuracy, for the sake of getting in-depth insights from this analysis, four (4) additional columns were created to contain information on Regions, Cumulative Sale per Region, Year, and Decade, extracted from existing columns in the dataset. The dataset used for this project after modification contains eighteen (18) columns in total.

Here are the definitions of each column:
- Title - contains different game titles; 
- Console - Console or platform on which consumer can access the game; 
- Genre - Genre of the game; 
- Publisher - Publisher of the game;
- Developer - Developer of the game; 
- Critic Score - Metacritic score (out of 10); 
- Total Sales - Global sales of copies in millions;
- Na Sales - North American sales of copies in millions;
- Jp Sales - Japanese sales of copies in millions; 
- Pal Sales -European & African sales of copies in millions; 
- Other Sales - Rest of the world sales of copies in millions; 
- Release Date - Date the game was released;
- Last Update - Date the data was last updated
 
The four additional columns contain the following information:
- Regions – global locations of video game audience; 
- Cumulative Sales per Region – sum of sales from each region that made up the total global sales; 
- Year – the year game title was released; 
- Decade – periodic grouping of video game titles extracted from the release-date column 

## Data Analysis and Insights
First and foremost, the objective of this analysis is to provide business intelligence and insights on the top-selling video game titles worldwide. Secondly, it aims to determine the year with the highest number of video game titles sold and the corresponding revenue generated. Additionally, the analysis seeks to identify trends in video game sales and industry growth over time, highlighting notable periods of growth and decline.

The analysis also includes console grouping by genre to assess video game title sales performance based on console-genre specialization. This involves examining sales performance in terms of volume and revenue generated by specific consoles across different genres. Furthermore, it compares aggregated video game title sales by region, with detailed consideration of both top and least-selling titles with reference to quantity sold and revenue generated.
In other words, the analysis prioritizes identifying the reasons behind the sales performance and revenue disparities among different regions.

**This analysis provides answers to the following questions**:

**1. Which titles sold the most worldwide?** 

This analysis examines video game titles with the highest total sales, and more importantly, global appeal. To identify video game titles that sold the most worldwide in Microsoft Excel, firstly, a pivot table was used to calculate the total global income made by the video game industry from game titles sold. Secondly, a top ten (10) filtered pivot table comprising titles and count-of-sales was created and visualized using pivot chart (bar chart) to display the results.

|Total Sales of Video Game Titles|
:--------------------------------:
|$6,599.32|

The pivot table analyzes the top ten (10) selling video game titles worldwide, providing a clearer understanding of the sales performance of titles that best met consumers' needs.

- As a result of the analysis done, ‘Grand Theft Auto’, ‘Call of Duty’ series, and ‘Minecraft’ are the top selling video game titles, generating commensurate income for the industry worldwide. This is a strong indication of their global acceptability by a wide range of video-game consumers and their strong standing in the global video game market. This success could be attributed to the quality and user-friendliness of the consoles and genres they belong to, and by extension, consumers’ preferences.

In an attempt to dig deeper and make this analysis more insightful, further effort was made to compare video game title sales and critic scores using the critic-score column in the dataset with a meta-critic scale of 1-10. The goal was to identify whether a correlation exist between critic-score of game titles and their sales. This correlation was examined by creating two (2) pivot tables: one to calculate the average critic-score and another to sum of total sales. Additionally, and a pivot chart – column chart was created for visualization.

:--------------------:
|7.22|

This pivot table shows the correlation between critic scores and total sales of video game titles, indicating how critics' reviews of game features influence and shape revenue generation.

- This analysis showed that top selling video game titles have an average critic-score of ‘7.2’. Similarly, it was discovered that the higher the critic score of a particular video-game title, the higher the income generated from the sales of such video game titles.
- Video game titles with Metacritic scores of 8-9 sold the most and generated the highest revenue in the video game industry over time. 
- It was factually established that video game titles with critic score of 5 and above sold the most and made more revenue while video game titles below 5 critic-score had lower sales and income respectively. This means game titles with higher critic score had the most sales and generated the most income compared to game titles with low critic score.

**2. Which year had the highest sales? Has the industry grown over time?** 

This identifies the year with the highest sales from video-game titles, taken into consideration both volume and revenue, trends and patterns of the video game titles sold over a period of time. A detailed time-series examination of noticeable changes in the sales of game titles and significantly, how the video game industry has wholesomely fared over time based on the information in the dataset. To achieve this set objective in Microsoft Excel, expectedly, total revenue generated globally by the video game industry has to be known. To calculate global revenue of video game titles, a pivot table was created to sum the total sales column in the dataset.
